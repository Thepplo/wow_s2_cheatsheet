    <h1 id="section4">Demolition Duo</h1>
    <div class="area">
        <h2>Demolition Duo<img class="roundrect" src="azerite-golem.png"></h2>
        <p>A potentially very chaotic fight that revolves around dealing with the 6 <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>Bombs</span> the bosses spawn periodically.<br>
            Think of them like the bombs in the First Boss of Siege of Boralus,
            they will explode for massive AoE if they time out.<br>
            These are dealt with through the other mechanics of the boss.<br>
            A quick note is that this boss consists of 2 dudes, <span style='font-weight:bold; color:orange;'>Quickfuse</span> and <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'> Bront</span>.<br>
            They don't share a healthpool and if one dies before the other, the survivor will get a ramping damage buff. So try to kill them evenly, but it isn't as punishing as third boss of SV for example.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span style='font-weight:bold; text-decoration:underline; color:gold;'> Bomb stuff</span></p>
            <p class=indented-text> 
            <span class="abilitynoint">Big Bada Boom:</span> The boss spawns 6 <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>Bombs</span> around the arena.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Kinetic Explosive Gel:</span> <span style='font-weight:bold; color:orange;'>Quickfuse</span> applies a
            dispellable <span style='font-weight:bold; color:green;'>magic debuff</span> on someone.<br>
            The person with the debuff has an impact circle around them,
            if a <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>bomb</span> is inside the radius when the debuff is <span style='font-weight:bold; color:green;'>dispelled</span>,
            the bomb will disappear.<br>
            This one of the main mechanics used for removing <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>bombs</span> so if you have the debuff stand next to a bomb and call for a dispel.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Barreling Charge:</span><span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'> Bront</span> targets a random <strong>(non-tank)</strong> and draws an arrow towards them.<br>
            After a delay he will charge in that direction, disabling any <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>Bombs</span> he runs through.<br>
            <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'> Bront</span> will recast this twice, first on another random target, and finally again <strong>always on the tank</strong>.<br>
            Before this ability goes out <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'> Bront</span> should be tanked in a spot where
            it makes it easy for the person with the charge to aim it into <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>bombs</span>.<br>
            Per <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>bomb</span> wave we have 2 casts of <span class="abilitynoint">Kinetic Explosive Gel</span>
            and 1 cast of  <span class="abilitynoint">Barreling Charge</span> to get rid of them.<br>
           </p>
        <p>
            <span class="tankbuster">Wallop:</span> Does what it says on the can.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Shoot:</span><span style='font-weight:bold; color:orange;'>Quickfuse</span> shoots random player.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">B.B.B.F.C:</span><span style='font-weight:bold; color:orange;'>Quickfuse</span> does multiple frontal lines in a fan.<br>

        <p>This boss seems simple on paper but is made hard by his  <span style='color:green; font-weight: bold;'>tether</span> mechanic.<br>
            On pull the boss will tether 2 dps players, and 1 dps + the healer together. Dealing constant rot damage whilst the <span style='color:green; font-weight: bold;'>tethers</span> are up.<br>
            Also if the two <span style='color:green; font-weight: bold;'>tethered</span> people move too far away from eachother, they will be snapped back together.<br>
            This becomes very troublesome with the rest of the boss' mechanics.<br>
            <span class="tankbuster">Sludge Claws:</span> Heavy tankbuster.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Mudslide:</span> Wide line frontal.<br>
            When this frontal comes out the group should have already decided which <strong>direction</strong> they should all dodge it in.
            Otherwise the <span style='color:green; font-weight: bold;'>tethers</span> will snap you back into it.<br>
            
            <span class="abilitynoint">Awaking the Swamp:</span> Spawns large swirlies around the room that later explode, unleashing waves from the original swirlie.<br>
            When he explodes the swirlies he will also do large pulsing AoE damage to the entire group.<br>
            Again when these waves come out, everyone should be agreed in which direction to dodge to avoid snapping the <span style='color:green; font-weight: bold;'>tethers</span>.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Razorchoke vines:</span> Reapplies the tethers and then repeats previous mechanics.<br>
