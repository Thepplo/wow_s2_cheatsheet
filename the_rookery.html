    <h1 id="section4">Stormguard Corren</h1>
    <div class="area">
        <h2>Stormguard Corren<img class="roundrect" src="korren.png"></h2>
        <p>The main mechanic here is his ability <span class="abilitynoint">Chaotic Corruption:</span><br>
            This is a hot potato 4s DoT debuff, meaning it spreads after it times out/gets dispelled. It spreads to the closest person and leaves the holder with a
            6s vulnerability debuff. You always have to pass it to someone new.<br>
        <span class="abilitynoint">Crush Reality:</span> Targets someone with a big circle that Corren jumps to. When he lands, cyclones will spawn from the circle. This makes positioning with the debuff complicated.<br>
        <span class="abilitynoint">Dark Gravity:</span> Boss tries to suck in players while dealing ticking aoe damage. Both this and <span class="abilitynoint">Crush Reality:</span> leave puddles after them.<br>

            <p class="indented-text">Very scary and weird dude.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Void Extraction:</span> A cast that extracts void essence from everything around him, including us and all mobs around him.<br>
                All targets that get extracted get a damage penalty debuff and for every extracted target the Stone gets a stacking damage buff.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Unleashed Darkness:</span>At 40% the stone casts this 18 second long ability. Pulsing aoe damage and spawning swirlies.<br>
                This gets very fucky very fast with the damage amp/decreasing debuffs.<br>

    <div class="area">
        <h2>Voidstone Monstrosity<img class="roundrect" src="monstrosity.png"></h2>
        <p>Boss is stationary in the middle of a U-shaped, so there are 3 sides to it. It is encouraged to spread out. Healer should always be in the middle to reach people.<br>
        <span class="tankbuster">Oblivion Wave:</span> Tankbuster that spawns a wave of shadow that shoots out behind the tank. Aim this away from people.<br>
        <span class="abilitynoint"> Unstable Corruption:</span> Puts <span style='text-color:white; font-weight:bold;'>2 magic debuffs</span> on players that leave puddles when timed out/dispelled.<br>
        <span class="abilitynoint">Null upheaval:</span>Massive aoe slam that spawn swirlies.<br>
            Also spawns 4 void pillars around the area. 2 at the front and 1 at each side at the points of the U. After the slam players will get a <span style='text-color: blue; font-weight:bold;'> blue circle</span>
            around them. Use these to detonate the pillars. This is why we should spread. If pillars are detonated they will spawn an AOE pulsing add that basically just wipes us.<br>
