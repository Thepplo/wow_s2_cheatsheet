            <span class="abilitynoint">Ricocheting Blade:</span>Same Ability as the miniboss before, can be scary when combined with the next move but CAN be LoS'd.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Seismic Stomp:</span> Aoe nuke.<br>

    <div class="area">
        <h2>Xav the Fallen<img class="roundrect" src="azerite-golem.png"></h2>
        <p>This boss can be quite troublesome if you don't stay on top of his mechanics and can't meet the damage checks.</p>
        <p><span class="tankbuster">Brutal Combo:</span> A very heavy-hitting tank combo.</p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Oppressive Banner:</span> Xav summons a banner that pulses a stacking movement speed slowing debuff to all players. This NEEDS to die fast or next mechanic becomes very punishing.</p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Might of Maldraxxus:</span> Xav leaps to the center of the arena, dealing extremely high group damage that everyone needs to be topped for.<br>
            He then performs 3 types of frontals, a line forward, a half circle and then a full circle which need to be dodged. Doing these dodges with stacks of slows can be difficult w/o movement abilities.</p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Blood and Glory:</span> Xav sends down 2 players that duel eachother. Because he will soon spawn a banner up top, the best way to handle this is for one person to let the other person win.<br>
            The winner of the duel get a damage amp and the loser gets a damage reduction, try to determine the winner by who was CDs up.

                When the guardian dies he leaves an <span style=' color: green; font-weight: bold;'>orb </span> that can be picked up. Putting this orb in either the right/left slot in a portal determines where it takes you.<br>
            </p>
            <p> Furthermore this sheet will cover the mobs present in the left->left->left route with the portals which is currently believed to be easiest.</p>

        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Well of Darkness:</span> Puts a DoT on 2 players, don't stand near them as this does damage in a small aoe around the player.</p>

        <p><span class="tankbuster">Draw Souls:</span> This is his most important cast, EVERYONE will spawn a ghost on them after a time that need to be killed before they reach the boss.
            Everyone should stack and then burn them down.
