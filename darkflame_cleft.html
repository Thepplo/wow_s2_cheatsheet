          <p> After the third boss you will start the minecart event. This involves standing near a minecart with a candle that provides light which is necessary to heal/dps the mobs on the way.<br>
            The candle will slowly burn out, to fill it up again you need to collect candles on the way and bring it to the cart. A ranged player can tag mobs to pull them towards the cart.

        <p>The Fight "starts" with an intermission where you ride a fast minecart while the Darkness chases you. While on this ride you can throw Dynamite on The Darkness to damage it.<br>

          This candle provides light and can be picked up by anyone with the extra action button after a short cast. When picked up you can move it.<br>
          To refuel the candle you need to go out and pick up candles by the ends of the arena and bring it back to the main <span style='color:pink; font-weight: bold;'>candle</span> like in the minecart event.<br>
          If the candle is drained fully the boss will fear you.<br>

          move this away from your friends and especially <span style='color:pink; font-weight: bold;'> the candle</span> as this will drain it.<br>
        <span class="abilitynoint">Umbral slash:</span> Targets <span style='color:pink; font-weight: bold;'> the candle</span> with an wide frontal.
          Pick it up and move it away from the frontal as this will drain it, dodge the frontal.
       <span class="abilitynoint">Eternal Darkness:</span> A very heavy unavoidable AoE damage channel that does 4 ticks of damage.<br>
          This also drains <span style='color:pink; font-weight: bold;'> the candle</span> heavily so try to have it topped before and try to have a candle on standby for the AoE.<br>
       <span class="abilitynoint">Call Darkspawn:</span> Summons adds that try to drain the candle with a <span style='color:#42cef5; font-weight: bold;'>kickable</span> cast.
