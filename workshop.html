        <p>The main mechanic here is his ability <span class="abilitynoint">Chaotic Corruption:</span><br>
            This is a hot potato 4s DoT debuff, meaning it spreads after it times out/gets dispelled. It spreads to the closest person and leaves the holder with a
            6s vulnerability debuff. You always have to pass it to someone new.<br>
        </p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Crush Reality:</span> Targets someone with a big circle that Corren jumps to. When he lands, cyclones will spawn from the circle. This makes positioning with the debuff complicated.<br></p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Dark Gravity:</span> Boss tries to suck in players while dealing ticking aoe damage. Both this and <span class="abilitynoint">Crush Reality:</span> leave puddles after them.<br></p>

        <p>Boss is stationary in the middle of a U-shaped, so there are 3 sides to it. It is encouraged to spread out. Healer should always be in the middle to reach people.</p>
        <p><span class="tankbuster">Oblivion Wave:</span> Tankbuster that spawns a wave of shadow that shoots out behind the tank. Aim this away from people.<br></p>

            Also spawns 4 void pillars around the area. 2 at the front and 1 at each side at the points of the U. After the slam players will get a <span style='text-color: blue; font-weight:bold;'> blue circle</span>
            around them. Use these to detonate the pillars. This is why we should spread. If pillars are detonated they will spawn an AOE pulsing add that basically just wipes us.<br>
