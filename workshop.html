            <p>Note: Alot about both the first area and boss have changed since BFA.</p>

                <h2>Notable Mobs:</h2>
                <p>The first area features a large group of 3 different enemy types. Whilst doing these packs, sawblades will periodically spawn at the edges of the platform and move in. Watch out for these!
                <p><strong class="caster">Bomb Tonk :</strong><br></p>
                <p class="indented-text">Probably the most dangerous of the 3 enemies.<br>

            <h2>Tussle Tonks<img class="roundrect" src="kyrioss.png"></h2>
            <p>This boss has seen a substantial rework since it's debut in BFA, they now need to be <span style='font-weight:bold;'>killed at the same time</span> and have new mechanics.<br>
                The arena, like before, will periodically spawn sawblades that need to be dodged. The blades also knock you back which can combo you with another mechanic.<br>
                There are also 4 <span style='color:pink;'>hammers</span> scattered throughout the arena's edge which will play an important role for both bosses.
              <p><span class="dangerousmob"> G.4.U.:</span></p>
                <p class="indented-text"><span class="abilitynoint"> Foe Flipper:</span> Targets a player, and after a brief duration, will deal damage to them and knock them back.<br>

                    this is the ability that can combo with knockbacks, be careful of landing on a mine if you know you will be knocked back. .<br>
                  <span class="abilitynoint"> Maximum Thrust:</span> Targets a random player, the tank will, after drawing a frontal line, drive towards that player quickly, dodge this.<br> 
                </p>

                  <span class="abilitynoint"> Ground Pound:</span> Multiple instances of unavoidable AoE damage.<br>
                  <span class="abilitynoint"> Platinum Plating:</span> A personal buff of armor that needs to be removed by kiting him into a <span style='color:pink;'>hammer</span>.<br>
                    When a <span style='color:pink;'>hammer</span> has hit the boss it will deactivate rendering it unusable.
                </p>
            <p> This is a section about the <span style='color:gold;'> Maximum Thrust/Platinum Plating overlap</span>.<br>
                These 2 casts overlap, so if you want to minmax you can bait <span class="dangerousmob"> G.4.U.</span> to charge into the  <span style='color:pink;'>hammer</span>
                that will remove <span class="abilitynoint"> Platinum Plating</span>.<br>
                If you pull this off both bosses will be hit by the hammer and stunned at the same location allowing for big damage.<br>

        You can see the direction the bot will travel in by an arrow they draw towards the circle.<br>
        Think of these like the <span style='color: purple; font-weight: bold;'>purple orbs</span> that the last boss in City of Threads spawn.
