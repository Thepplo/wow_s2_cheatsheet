                <h2>Notable Mobs:</h2>
                <p> This area is very confined with alot of deadly mobs. When the room is cleared, more packs of Templars, Paladins and Priests come down the stairs.</p>
                <p><strong class="dangerousmob">Argent Paladin:</strong><br></p>

    <div class="area">
        <h2>Baron Braunpyke<img class="roundrect" src="azerite-golem.png"></h2>
        <p>It's a good idea for the party to stack on one side of the room at the beginning here to bait swirlies.</p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Hammer of Purity:</span> Spawns 3 swirlies at 3 player's locations. These explode into swirling hammers that expand outwards, this is why it's a good idea to stack
            and then to move to the other side.
        </p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Sacrificial Pyre:</span> Spawns a circle with a number of orbs around it. The circle needs to be soaked a number of times according to the number of orbs. Soaking an orb leaves a DoT.
            Every time an orb is soaked AoE damage goes onto the group. If Sacrificial Pyre is not soaked, it's a wipe.
        </p>
        <p><span class="abilitywithint">Burning Light:</span>Interruptable cast that deals AoE damage and heals the boss if it goes through.</p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Vindictive Wrath:</span> Boss pops wings and buffs his other abilities, i.e. more swirlies, more pyre soaks and circles around boss that need to be avoided.</span>.</p>

    <h1 id="section5">Before Final Boss</h1>
        <div class="area">
            <p>Most of the mobs here are recycled from previous areas but there's a few new ones.</p>
            <h2>Notable Mobs:</h2>

            <p class="indented-text">Caster with one dangerous cast.<br>

            <p><strong class="miniboss">Sir Braunpyke:</strong><br></p>
            <p class="indented-text">Very dangerous <span style=' color:purple;'> miniboss</span> that you probably don't want to pull more packs on.
                There is a patrol around the room so pulling Braunpyke back to the entrance is a good idea.<br>
            <span class="abilitynoint">Aura:</span> Braunpyke has an aura that pulses constant rot damage to the entire group, this is why pulling casters (which there are alot of here) probably isn't a good idea.<br>
            <span class="tankbuster">Blazing Strike:</span> A very heavy tankbuster. Make sure to mitigate this to help your healer, as they are probably busy with the rot damage.<br>
                Killing Braunpyke is neccesary to open area to last boss.

    <div class="area">
        <h2>Prioress Murpray<img class="roundrect" src="rixxa.png"></h2>
        <p>When pulled will cover area with swirlies that create dangerous puddles</p>
        <p><span class="abilitywithint">Holy Smite:</span> Targets a player with a large damage nuke. This can be <span style=' color:#42cef5;'>interrupted </span>so having an interrupt order here is key.<br></p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Blinding Light:</span> A "lookaway" mechanic, if you are facing the boss when it finishes you are disoriented.<br></p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Holy Flame:</span> Spawns a circle on a player, move out of it.<br></p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Purify:</span> Targets the player with a beam that must be kited, beam will leave puddles of light on the ground, try to aim these puddles at the edges of the room.<br></p>
        <p>At 50% the boss will transition, jumping up to the top of the platform and starting to cast,<br></p>
        <p><span class="abilitynoint"> Embrace the Light:</span> Pulses aoe damage, will be interrupted when the boss' shield breaks.<br></p>
        <p>While she is channeling, the boss will spawn adds at the bottom of the stairs, these will melee whoever they want if they are in range, it appears that tanking these is very hard.<br>
            To counteract this, all players can stack at a point by the fence so that all adds group up and come up the stairs from a single direction.<br></p>
