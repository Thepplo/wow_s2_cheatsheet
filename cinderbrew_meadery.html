        <p>A potentially very chaotic fight that revolves around the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>adds</span> the boss spawns so let's talk about those first.
        <p><span class="abilitynoint">Snack Time:</span> The boss spawns <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>Barrels</span> around the arena.<br>
          These <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>Barrels</span> will continously spawn adds as long as they are up.
          The adds are called <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Raging Buzzbees</span>. These adds will jump around and place DoTs on the party.<br>
          When killed these <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Raging Buzzbees</span> will become <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Interactible</span>.
          If you click on them you will <span style='font-weight:bold;'>Ride</span> the bee, allowing you to use their ability to dash through <span style='font-weight:bold; color:pink;'>Barrels</span>, destroying them.<br>
          That is the main gimmick of this fight.<br>
        <span class="abilitynoint">Honey Marinade:</span> Puts a circle around the tank that will after a delay, do damage and drop a flame patch on the ground.<br>
          Try to position this around the edges of the arena.
        <span class="abilitynoint">Fluttering Wing:</span> A channel of unavoidable AoE damage that pushes everyone away slightly from the boss.<br>
          This becomes dangerous with the DoTs from the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Raging Buzzbees</span>. <br>

        <p>This is a very tank/cc heavy boss, all about managing the adds the boss spawns which will need to be kited. 
        <span class="abilitynoint">Spouting Stout:</span> Boss will spawn alot of swirlies, of which there are 2 kinds.<br>
          <span style='color:yellow; font-weight: bold;'>Yellow swirlies:</span> which are normal swirlies.<br>
          And <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Red swirlies:</span> which will spawn adds.<br>
          These <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Brew Drops</span> will run towards the boss. If they reach the boss, it will give the boss a 10% shield and he will do heavy AoE damage.<br>
          The <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Brew Drops</span> can be cc'd (roots,stuns,vortex,etc.) but it is recommended to kite these.<br>
          If they stay alive long they will become <span style='font-weight: bold;'>faster</span>.<br>
          On death the <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Brew Drops</span> will leave a puddle on the ground and slowly <span style='font-weight: bold;'>regenerate</span> to spawn again.<br>

         <span class="tankbuster">Bottoms Uppercut:</span> Heavy tank-buster that also knocks back.<br>
         <span class="abilitynoint">Burning Fermentation:</span> Applies a dispellable DoT <span style='font-weight:bold; color:green;'>magic debuff</span>.<br>

        <p>This can, again, become a very chaotic fight. It's all about managing the <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Big Barrels:</span> she spawns.<br>

        <span class="abilitynoint">Spread the Love!:</span> The boss spawns alot of barrels around the room, of which there are 2 kinds,<br>
        <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>4 Big Barrels</span> and alot of<span style='color:yellow; font-weight: yellow;'>Small barrels</span>.<br>
      Both barrels, when destroyed, will spawn multiple lava waves from it that need to be dodged, but when a <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Big Barrel</span> is destroyed it will apply
      a party wide <span style='font-weight: bold;'>STACKING</span> DoT that refreshes on multiple applications. Akin to <span style='color:purple; font-weight: bold;'>Skarmorak Shards</span> from SV.<br>
      These barrels will have to be destroyed by players with 2 different mechanics from the boss before she explodes all of them at the same time causing a wipe.<br>
        <span class="tankbuster">Cash Cannon:</span> Targets the <span style='color:pink; font-weight: bold;'>tank</span> with an wide frontal.<br>
      Aim this towards <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Barrels:</span> to destroy them.<br>
       <span class="abilitynoint">Burning Ricochet:</span> Targets 2 random party members with a damaging circle which will explode after a brief delay,
      any <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Barrels:</span> caught inside will ignite and explode.<br>
       <span class="abilitynoint">Let it Hail:</span> The boss channels HEAVY pusling AoE damage on everyone, whilst exploding any existing <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Barrels:</span>.<br>

      So as you can see this boss becomes hectic without a clear strategy on how to explode the barrels before <span class="abilitynoint">Let it Hail:</span>, and timing it correctly so that the DoT effect from the
      <span style='color:red; font-weight: bold;'>Big Barrels:</span> doesn't refresh/kill anyone.<br>
      What appears to be the leading strategy is to explode them in a <span style='font-weight: bold;'>1-1-1-1</span> fashion, as you get 2 <span class="tankbuster">Cash Cannons</span>
      and 2  <span class="abilitynoint">Burning Ricochets</span> per wave of barrels.
